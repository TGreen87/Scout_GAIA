## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that the current market for HR automation and AI consulting services in Australia is characterized by significant pricing inefficiencies driven by outdated delivery models, excessive overhead, and limited technological leverage. Through a fundamental redesign of the consulting and implementation approach, Tom Green Consulting can deliver equivalent or superior services at 60-85% below current market rates while maintaining healthy profit margins.
