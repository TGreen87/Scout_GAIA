# Melbourne SME User Testing Results

## Executive Summary

This report presents the comprehensive findings from user testing sessions conducted with 8 Melbourne-based small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across diverse industries. The testing focused on evaluating both the HR automation system and expanded AI consulting offerings, with particular attention to the modular pricing model and knowledge-sharing approach.

The testing revealed strong overall interest in both offerings, with participants particularly valuing the Australian compliance focus, modular approach to pricing, and knowledge transfer methodology. Several usability improvements were identified for the HR system, along with feature enhancement opportunities. The pricing model was well-received, though several refinements were recommended to better accommodate seasonal businesses and trades operations.

Key insights include the need for industry-specific workflows, stronger mobile capabilities for trades businesses, clearer visualization of AI implementation benefits, and more flexible payment options for businesses with irregular cash flows. The knowledge-sharing approach was highly valued across all segments, confirming our differentiation strategy.

These findings provide actionable recommendations to refine our offerings before market launch, with clear prioritization of enhancements based on user feedback. The testing also identified potential early adopters across various industries who expressed interest in beta testing or early implementation.
