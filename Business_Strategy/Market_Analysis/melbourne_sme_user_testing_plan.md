# Melbourne SME User Testing Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive plan outlines the approach for conducting targeted user testing with 5-10 Melbourne-based small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across various sectors. The testing will focus on gathering feedback on both the HR automation system and expanded AI consulting offerings, with special attention to the modular pricing model and knowledge-sharing approach.
