## Case Studies: SME Payment Flexibility in Action

### Small Retailer: Seasonal Cash Flow Management

**Client:** Melbourne Gift Shop Chain (8 employees, 20+ seasonal staff)
**Challenge:** Extreme seasonality with 60% of annual revenue in November-December
**Solution:** Retail Seasonal Staffing Plan with Revenue-Linked Option

The business pays a minimal base fee of $99/month during off-peak months, with additional per-employee charges only for active staff members. During the holiday season, they temporarily scale up without penalty. An additional 0.1% of monthly revenue is added to the subscription, capped at $299/month total. This structure reduced their effective annual HR system cost by 42% compared to traditional fixed subscriptions while providing enhanced capabilities during peak periods.

### Trade Business: Project-Based Payment Alignment

**Client:** Electrical Contracting Business (12 employees, 8 subcontractors)
**Challenge:** Irregular cash flow based on project timelines and payment schedules
**Solution:** Project-Aligned Payment Plan with Subcontractor Management Add-on

The electrical contractor aligns system payments with their project timelines. Initial system implementation was divided into four milestone payments, coinciding with payments from a major commercial project. Ongoing subscription costs fluctuate based on active projects, with a minimum base rate and additional charges only when projects are active. The subcontractor management module automatically tracks licensing, insurance, and compliance documentation, generating substantial value through risk reduction.

### Professional Services: Client-Based Cost Recovery

**Client:** Financial Advisory Firm (22 employees)
**Challenge:** Need to maintain premium HR capabilities while managing tight margins
**Solution:** Client-Based Billing with Value-Based Partnership elements

The financial advisory firm integrated the HR system costs into their client billing structure. Each client project includes a small "regulatory compliance" component that covers the HR system costs. Additionally, the system automatically generates regulatory compliance documentation for clients, creating a new revenue stream. A portion of this new revenue is shared with Tom Green Consulting through the Value-Based Partnership structure, creating aligned incentives for system optimization.

## Conclusion

This flexible payment framework addresses the diverse needs of Australian SMEs across various industries and growth stages. By aligning payment structures with business realities, seasonal patterns, and value realization, Tom Green Consulting removes the financial barriers that typically prevent small and medium businesses from implementing sophisticated HR and AI solutions.

The approach represents a fundamental disruption to traditional software and consulting payment models, providing unprecedented flexibility while maintaining sustainable business operations for both the client and service provider. This philosophy of fair, aligned, and flexible pricing serves as a key differentiator in the market and represents a core competitive advantage over larger, less adaptable competitors.
