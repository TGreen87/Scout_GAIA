# Financial Projections and Business Models
## Comparing Niche-Only vs. Dual System Approaches for HR Automation

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive financial analysis compares two strategic approaches for entering the HR automation market: a niche-focused solution exclusively for neurodivergent users versus a dual-interface system serving both neurodivergent and neurotypical users. Our projections span a 5-year horizon, incorporating detailed development costs, marketing expenses, revenue streams, pricing strategies, and ROI calculations.

The dual-system approach requires an additional initial investment of approximately $2.2 million (46% more than the niche-only approach), but delivers substantially stronger financial returns. Key findings include:

- **Total 5-Year Revenue**: $69.4M for dual system vs. $31.1M for niche-only (123% higher)
- **Cumulative 5-Year Profit**: $31.2M for dual system vs. $8.2M for niche-only (280% higher)
- **ROI**: 410% for dual system vs. 172% for niche-only
- **Payback Period**: 2.3 years for dual system vs. 3.7 years for niche-only
- **Year 5 Profit Margin**: 58% for dual system vs. 42% for niche-only

The dual-system approach reaches profitability earlier, achieves higher profit margins, and provides more stable revenue growth through diversified market opportunities. The unified codebase and shared infrastructure significantly reduce the incremental development and maintenance costs compared to running two completely separate systems, creating a compelling financial case for the dual approach.
