# SME-Focused Monetization Model
## Australian Small Business HR System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive monetization strategy for our HR system tailored specifically to Australian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The model is designed to balance accessibility for the smallest businesses with revenue growth opportunities as customers scale, while maintaining competitiveness in the Australian market.

The monetization strategy is structured around five core components:

1. **Size-based tiered pricing** that scales with business growth
2. **Feature-based subscription models** that allow customization
3. **Strategic partnership opportunities** with Australian accounting and business software providers
4. **Value-based ROI calculations** for different SME segments
5. **Flexible payment options** that accommodate Australian business budgeting practices

This model addresses the unique characteristics of the Australian SME market, particularly the price sensitivity of micro-businesses, the compliance focus of small businesses, and the customization needs of medium businesses. The strategy also accounts for industry-specific requirements across trades, retail/hospitality, professional services, healthcare, and manufacturing segments.

## 1. Size-Based Tiered Pricing Structure

### 1.1 Core Tier Definitions

Our pricing tiers are designed to align with typical Australian business size classifications and growth patterns:

#### 1.1.1 Micro Business Tier: "Essentials"

**Target:** 1-5 employees
**Base Price:** A$4.50 per employee per month (billed annually) or A$5.50 monthly
**Minimum Monthly Fee:** A$19.95

**Value Proposition:**
- Essential compliance coverage for the smallest businesses
- Simplified interface focused on must-have functions
- Affordable entry point for sole traders and micro-businesses
- Core Australian compliance automation

**Micro Business Size in Australia:**
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, approximately 61% of Australian businesses have 0-4 employees, representing over 1.4 million businesses. This tier targets this substantial market segment with an accessible price point.

#### 1.1.2 Small Business Tier: "Business"

**Target:** 6-19 employees
**Base Price:** A$7.50 per employee per month (billed annually) or A$9 monthly
**Minimum Monthly Fee:** None (per employee pricing only)

**Value Proposition:**
- Comprehensive compliance and HR management
- Full award interpretation and application
- Team management and scheduling features
- Basic reporting and analytics
- Choice of standard or neurodivergent-friendly interface

**Small Business Size in Australia:**
Approximately 35% of Australian businesses with employees have 5-19 staff members. This represents our core target market of established small businesses with dedicated HR needs but without specialized HR personnel.

#### 1.1.3 Medium Business Tier: "Professional"

**Target:** 20-50 employees
**Base Price:** A$10.50 per employee per month (billed annually) or A$12.50 monthly

**Value Proposition:**
- Advanced HR management features
- Sophisticated reporting and analytics
- Custom workflow capabilities
- API access for integrations
- Enhanced compliance management
- Premium support services

**Medium Business Size in Australia:**
Approximately 2.3% of Australian businesses have 20-199 employees, with the majority in the 20-50 range. This segment requires more sophistication but still lacks enterprise resources.

#### 1.1.4 Growth Business Tier: "Enterprise"

**Target:** 51-199 employees
**Base Price:** Custom pricing starting at A$9.50 per employee per month (billed annually) with volume discounts

**Value Proposition:**
- Volume discounts for larger employee counts
- Dedicated account management
- Custom implementation services
- Advanced integration capabilities
- Enterprise-grade security and controls
- Tailored compliance reporting

**Large SME Size in Australia:**
These businesses represent only 0.5% of all Australian businesses but have more complex needs and higher lifetime value.

### 1.2 Declining Per-Employee Cost Model

To incentivize growth and reduce price as a barrier to scaling, we implement a declining per-employee cost model:

| Employee Count | Business Plan Rate | Effective Discount |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 6-10 employees | A$7.50 per employee | Standard rate |
| 11-15 employees | A$7.25 per employee | 3.3% discount |
| 16-20 employees | A$7.00 per employee | 6.7% discount |
| 21-30 employees | A$6.75 per employee | 10% discount |
| 31-50 employees | A$6.50 per employee | 13.3% discount |
| 51+ employees | Custom pricing | 15%+ discount |

**Rationale:**
- Aligns cost with Australian business growth patterns
- Reduces "price shock" at tier boundaries
- Creates natural incentive for customers to add all employees to the system
- Avoids penalizing businesses for growth
- Maintains competitive pricing for larger SMEs
