### Founder Personal Announcement
```
I'm thrilled to announce the official launch of my new venture: Green AI Solutions!

After years in HR technology leadership at global companies like HPE, I recognized a clear gap: Australian SMEs struggling with compliance-heavy HR processes but being priced out of enterprise solutions.

Green AI Solutions bridges this gap with:

âœ… HR automation systems with Australian compliance built-in
âœ… Practical AI consulting with a knowledge transfer approach
âœ… Neurodivergent-friendly design (technology that works for everyone)
âœ… Modular solutions that grow with your business

Why this matters: Small businesses deserve the same technology advantages as large enterprises, without the enterprise price tag or complexity.

To celebrate our launch, I'm offering my network a complimentary 30-minute HR Automation Assessment (normally $250) with code LAUNCH2025.

I'd love to connect with:
- SME owners looking to streamline HR operations
- HR professionals seeking compliance solutions
- Operations leaders interested in process automation
- Anyone curious about practical AI implementation

Visit www.greenaisolutions.com.au to learn more and access free resources.

Thank you to everyone who has supported this journey. I'm excited to help Australian businesses leverage technology to solve real problems.
