# Neurodivergent Design

This directory contains design principles, UI components, and user journey specifications for Green AI Solutions' neurodivergent-friendly approach to system design.

## Overview

Green AI Solutions incorporates neurodivergent-friendly design as a core differentiator, creating technology that works effectively for both neurotypical and neurodivergent users. This approach expands market reach while providing a superior user experience for all users regardless of cognitive style.

## Directory Structure

- **[Core_Concepts/](Core_Concepts/)**: Fundamental design principles and system concepts for neurodivergent accessibility
- **[Interface_Components/](Interface_Components/)**: Specific UI components designed to support diverse cognitive styles
- **[User_Journey/](User_Journey/)**: User journeys comparing neurotypical and neurodivergent experiences

## Design Principles

1. **Adjustable Stimulation Levels**: Allow users to control the amount of visual and auditory stimulation
2. **Context Management**: Help users maintain awareness of context and transitions
3. **Energy Management**: Support executive function through energy-aware design
4. **Hyperfocus Accommodation**: Design for both hyperfocus states and inattentive states
5. **Clear Navigation**: Explicit, consistent, and predictable navigation patterns
6. **Reduced Working Memory Load**: Minimize requirements to hold information in working memory
7. **Time Awareness Support**: Provide time management and time awareness features
8. **Personalization**: Allow for individual customization of the interface

## Implementation Approach

The neurodivergent design approach is implemented through:

1. **Toggle System**: Users can switch between interface modes based on preference
2. **Contextual Adaptations**: Interface adapts based on user behavior and task context
3. **Personalization Options**: Extensive customization options for individual preferences
4. **Multi-Modal Input/Output**: Support for different ways of interacting with the system
5. **Consistent Structure**: Predictable patterns and structures across the system

## Business Impact

This design approach creates business value through:

1. **Expanded Market Reach**: Appeals to both neurotypical and neurodivergent users
2. **Competitive Differentiation**: Unique approach compared to standard HR systems
3. **Improved User Satisfaction**: Better user experience leads to higher satisfaction
4. **Increased Productivity**: Better alignment with diverse cognitive styles improves efficiency
5. **Workplace Inclusion**: Supports employers in creating more inclusive workplaces
