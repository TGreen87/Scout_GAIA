# Australian HR Compliance Framework
## Comprehensive Guide for SME HR System Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive compliance framework for an HR system designed specifically for Australian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The framework ensures adherence to federal and state-specific employment legislation across all Australian jurisdictions, with a particular focus on making compliance simple and accessible for small business owners including tradies.

The framework is structured to address the most critical compliance areas for Australian SMEs, including Fair Work regulations, modern awards, state-specific employment laws, workplace health and safety requirements, and various leave entitlements. It provides a clear roadmap for implementing these compliance requirements within the HR system, ensuring that small business owners can easily meet their legal obligations without needing specialized knowledge.

By implementing this framework, the HR system will enable Australian SMEs to:

1. Automatically apply the correct minimum employment standards
2. Stay up-to-date with legislative changes across jurisdictions
3. Reduce the risk of costly non-compliance penalties
4. Simplify award interpretation and application
5. Manage state variations in employment regulations

This framework is designed to be practical and implementation-focused, providing specific guidance on how each compliance requirement should be incorporated into the system's architecture, user interface, and data models.
