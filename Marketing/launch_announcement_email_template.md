Hi [First Name],

I'm thrilled to announce the official launch of Green AI Solutions, my new venture focused on making HR automation and AI consulting accessible and affordable for Australian small and medium businesses.

## Why I Started Green AI Solutions

After years working in HR technology leadership roles at global companies like HPE, I saw a clear gap in the market: Australian SMEs struggling with compliance-heavy HR processes but being priced out of enterprise solutions.

Green AI Solutions addresses this by offering:

ðŸ”¹ **Australian Compliance Built-In**: HR systems designed specifically for Fair Work Act and Australian employment regulations
ðŸ”¹ **Neurodivergent-Friendly Design**: Inclusive interfaces that work for all team members
ðŸ”¹ **Knowledge Transfer Approach**: We teach you everything, building capability instead of dependency
ðŸ”¹ **Disruptive Pricing**: Enterprise-level solutions at SME-friendly prices

## Our Two Core Offerings:

1. **HR Automation System**: A modular, compliance-focused HR platform specifically for Australian SMEs, starting with what you need and growing with your business.

2. **AI Consulting Services**: Practical AI implementation focused on real business outcomes with a knowledge transfer approach.

## Launch Resources (All Free)
