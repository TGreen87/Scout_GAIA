## General Network Announcement Template

**Subject:** Exciting news: Launching Green AI Solutions, my new HR automation & AI venture

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I hope this message finds you well! I wanted to share some exciting news with you personally before our public announcement next week.

After 15+ years in HR leadership positions at global technology companies like HPE, I've decided to launch my own venture – Green AI Solutions – focused on making HR automation and practical AI implementation accessible to Australian SMEs.

Why I'm doing this:

Throughout my career, I've seen how enterprise-level HR technology and AI implementations can transform businesses. However, these solutions have remained largely inaccessible to small and medium enterprises due to cost, complexity, and the lack of Australian-specific compliance features.

Green AI Solutions directly addresses these gaps with:

1. HR automation that's built specifically for Australian compliance requirements
2. A unique dual-interface approach that accommodates neurodivergent employees
3. A practical AI implementation methodology designed for businesses without massive IT departments
4. Pricing that significantly undercuts enterprise solutions

I'd love to catch up and tell you more about what we're building. Perhaps most importantly, I'd value your insights and feedback as we bring this venture to market.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call in the next couple of weeks? I'd be grateful for your perspective.

Our official launch is set for [Launch Date]. You can also check out our website at www.greenaisolutions.com.au to learn more about our approach.

Looking forward to reconnecting,

I'm thrilled to announce that I'm launching Green AI Solutions, a new venture focused on making HR automation and AI implementation accessible to Australian SMEs. After [X] years in HR leadership at companies like HPE, I've seen firsthand the challenges that HR teams face with compliance, administrative burden, and technology implementation.

What makes Green AI Solutions different:

1. Built specifically for Australian regulatory requirements (Fair Work Act, Modern Awards, etc.)
2. Includes a unique dual-interface approach to accommodate neurodivergent employees
3. Focuses on practical implementation with knowledge transfer to your team
4. Offers significantly more affordable pricing than enterprise solutions

As someone who understands the HR landscape, I'd particularly value your insights on our approach. I'm offering complimentary HR compliance audits to my professional network during our launch phase, and I'd be happy to include you if it would be helpful.

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I hope all is well with you! I wanted to share some exciting news about my new venture that sits at the intersection of AI technology and practical business implementation.

After [X] years in global technology companies like HPE, I'm launching Green AI Solutions – a company focused on making AI implementation and HR automation accessible to Australian SMEs.

The technology landscape for small and medium businesses has been frustrating to watch. While enterprises leverage sophisticated AI and automation, smaller organizations struggle with implementation, often ending up with either overly complex solutions or simplistic tools that don't deliver real value.

Green AI Solutions addresses this gap through:

1. Practical AI implementation with a focus on immediate business value
2. Technology that accommodates diverse working styles (including a neurodivergent-friendly interface)
3. A knowledge transfer methodology that builds internal capabilities
4. Australian-specific solutions (particularly for HR compliance)

As someone with deep technology expertise, I'd value your perspective on our approach. Our launch is set for [Launch Date], but I'd love to get your insights beforehand.

Could we schedule a brief 15-minute call in the coming weeks? I'd be grateful for your feedback, and I'm happy to share more details about what we're building.

You can also explore our website at www.greenaisolutions.com.au to see our approach to practical AI implementation for SMEs.
