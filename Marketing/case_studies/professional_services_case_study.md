# Case Study: Professional Services Firm Increases Billable Hours by 15%

## How a Melbourne Accounting Firm Streamlined Operations with Intelligent Automation

**Industry:** Professional Services (Accounting)  
**Company Size:** 42 employees  
**Location:** Melbourne, Victoria  
**Solutions Used:** HR Command Center, AI Consulting, Process Automation, Neurodivergent Interface

## Client Overview

### Client Profile

A well-established Melbourne accounting firm providing tax, audit, and advisory services to small and medium businesses. With 42 employees including accountants, administrative staff, and partners, the firm has been operating for over 25 years with a reputation for personalized service. The team includes 28 professional staff (accountants, bookkeepers, and tax specialists), 8 administrative personnel, and 6 partners. The firm serves approximately 450 business clients and 800 individual clients annually.

### Business Context

The accounting industry has been undergoing significant transformation due to automation technologies and increasing client expectations for digital service delivery. The firm was facing growing competitive pressure from both traditional competitors and digital-first accounting services. Several senior team members were approaching retirement, creating knowledge transfer challenges. Additionally, the firm had identified that approximately 20% of billable hours were being lost to administrative tasks and inefficiencies. They were also seeking to better support their neurodivergent staff members, who made up approximately 15% of their professional team and often excelled in technical accounting work.

## Challenge

### Key Challenges

The firm faced several critical challenges:

1. **Administrative Burden**: Professional staff were spending approximately 30% of their time on administrative tasks rather than billable work. This included manual data entry, document management, and internal communication about client matters. Partners estimated this equated to approximately $380,000 in unrealized revenue annually.

2. **Knowledge Management**: With several senior staff approaching retirement, the firm risked losing valuable institutional knowledge about clients, processes, and regulatory interpretations. Knowledge sharing was primarily informal and undocumented.

3. **Technology Adoption**: Previous technology implementations had seen limited adoption due to complex interfaces and insufficient training. The firm had invested in several systems that were being underutilized due to resistance from staff.

4. **Neurodivergent Staff Support**: Several highly talented team members with ADHD, autism, and dyslexia were struggling with context switching between multiple systems and inconsistent process documentation, despite their exceptional technical capabilities.

5. **Client Onboarding**: The client onboarding process took an average of 3 weeks and involved multiple handoffs between team members, creating delays and inconsistent client experiences. Documentation was often incomplete, requiring follow-up with clients.

6. **Compliance Management**: Tracking continuing professional education requirements, license renewals, and independence declarations was a manual process prone to oversights. The firm had recently discovered several compliance gaps during an internal review.

### Previous Approaches

The firm had previously attempted to address these challenges through:

1. Implementing a practice management system, which staff found overly complex and rigid. Adoption remained low, with many team members creating workarounds using spreadsheets and emails.

2. Creating process documentation in a shared drive, which quickly became outdated and was rarely consulted. The documentation lacked standardization and was difficult to navigate.

3. Hiring additional administrative staff, which increased overhead costs without resolving the underlying inefficiencies. The additional staff became overwhelmed with manual processes.

4. Conducting traditional training sessions on existing systems, which provided temporary improvements but failed to address the fundamental usability and workflow issues.

These approaches had yielded limited results, and the firm continued to lose potential billable hours to administrative tasks. Staff satisfaction was declining, particularly among neurodivergent team members who found the inconsistent processes especially challenging.

## Solution

### Solution Overview

Green AI Solutions implemented a comprehensive approach combining HR automation, process optimization, and AI-enabled knowledge management:

1. The HR Command Center with professional services-specific modules configured for accounting industry requirements, including CPE tracking, independence monitoring, and license management.

2. Process automation for key workflows including client onboarding, engagement management, and internal approvals, with AI-powered document processing to reduce manual data entry.

3. Knowledge management system with intelligent capture of institutional knowledge from senior staff, making expertise searchable and accessible across the firm.

4. Dual-interface system optimized for both neurotypical and neurodivergent users, allowing team members to select their preferred interaction mode.

5. Custom dashboards for partners and managers to monitor team capacity, compliance status, and client engagement progress.

The implementation followed our knowledge transfer methodology, ensuring the firm's team understood the system thoroughly and could maintain and enhance it independently after implementation.
