# MVP Prototype with Modular Architecture
## Australian SME HR System Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development approach for a functional MVP prototype of the Australian SME HR system with a modular architecture. The system features both standard and neurodivergent-friendly interfaces and focuses on core compliance features essential for Australian SMEs and tradies. 

The architecture enables a "build-as-you-grow" approach where customers can start with basic compliance functionality and add specialized modules as needed. Each component is separately chargeable but seamlessly integrates across the platform, creating multiple revenue streams while keeping the entry barrier low for small businesses.

This modular design aligns with Tom Green's vision of undercutting the market with an easy-to-use solution that doesn't require complex customization while complementing his consulting service offerings.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Modular Architecture

The system is built on a modular architecture with the following characteristics:

- **Core Platform**: A foundational layer providing authentication, user management, data storage, and basic functionality
- **Functional Modules**: Standalone components that can be enabled/disabled and purchased separately
- **Unified Data Model**: Consistent data structure across all modules for seamless integration
- **API-First Design**: All functionality exposed through APIs to support integration and extensibility
- **Interface Variants**: Standard and neurodivergent-friendly interfaces sharing the same underlying functionality

### 2. Compliance-First Approach

Australian compliance is at the center of the system design:

- **Built-In Compliance Logic**: Core Australian labor law compliance embedded in the foundation
- **State-Specific Variations**: Support for different rules across states and territories
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Automatic detection of potential compliance issues
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated creation of compliant documentation
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive tracking of compliance-related actions

### 3. Exceptional Usability

The system prioritizes usability for non-technical users:

- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for on-site use by tradies and field workers
- **Simplified Workflows**: Complex compliance tasks reduced to intuitive steps
- **Visual Guidance**: Clear visual cues and contextual help
- **Minimal Data Entry**: Smart defaults and templates to reduce manual input
- **Offline Capability**: Basic functionality when internet connection is limited

### 4. Dual Interface System

Both standard and neurodivergent-friendly interfaces are implemented:

- **Standard Interface**: Clean, conventional UI following familiar patterns
- **Neurodivergent Interface**: Adaptable UI with focus on reduced distraction, clear organization, and customizable visual preferences
- **Shared Core Logic**: Both interfaces use the same business logic and data layer
- **User Preference**: Users can switch between interfaces based on personal preference
